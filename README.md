# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **K-Means clustering**.  
The goal is to generate actionable customer segments that can support marketing, retention, and revenue optimization strategies.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Businesses often struggle to understand which customers drive the most value and which are at risk of churn.  
This project answers the question:

> **How can customers be segmented based on transactional behavior to support data-driven business decisions?**

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering using RFM metrics
3. Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
4. Business interpretation and segment labeling
5. Visualization and storytelling using Power BI

## 🧪 Dataset
- [Retail Transactions: Online Sales Dataset (Year 2010-2011)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanks1202/retail-transactions-online-sales-dataset)
- Transaction-level data including invoice date, quantity, unit price, and customer ID

---

## 📊 Customer Segments Identified
- **High Value Customers**  
  Customers with high purchase frequency, high monetary value, and recent activity.

- **Loyal Customers**  
  Customers with consistent purchasing behavior and medium-to-high spending.

- **Regular Customers**  
  Majority of customers contributing revenue through volume.

- **Churn Risk Customers**  
  Customers with low engagement and long inactivity periods.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A small number of customers contribute disproportionately high revenue.
- Most revenue volume comes from regular customers due to scale.
- High Value and Loyal customers require retention-focused strategies.
- Churn Risk customers should be targeted with cost-efficient re-engagement campaigns.

---

## 🚀 Business Recommendations
- **High Value Customers:** Priority service, exclusive offers, retention programs  
- **Loyal Customers:** Upselling and cross-selling opportunities  
- **Regular Customers:** Engagement campaigns to increase loyalty  
- **Churn Risk Customers:** Limited reactivation strategies to control cost

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Create PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE etl_transactions_db;
2. Create tables using the provided schema
   - Create dimension and fact tables in PostgreSQL before running the pipeline.
3. (Optional) Truncate fact table before reload:
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE fact_transactions RESTART IDENTITY;
4. Run ETL pipeline:
```bash 
   python scripts/load_to_db.py
```
